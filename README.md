# Literature Review of GHC Core

This document aims at giving an rough overview of the evolution of GHC Core,
System FC, through publications. The motivation of this document is to aid
developers who hack into GHC Core in gaining a theoretical understanding of each
design choice involved in the type system.

Note that this document is not supposed to be a stand-alone literature; that is,
it is impossible to understand all type systems solely by reading this document.
Instead, it is supposed to be read along with the papers. It gives a summary of
each type system's motivation, and highlights points that are important or
different from previous type systems, which is expected to help the process of
paper reading.

Assumed background: Types and Programming Languages.
